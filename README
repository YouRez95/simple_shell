# Simple Shell Project

## Description
This project is a simple Unix shell implementation developed in C. The goal of this project is to apply everything we've learned in C programming so far, and provide a basic command-line interface to interact with the underlying operating system. The shell supports various standard shell features, including executing commands, managing processes, and basic input/output redirection.

## Features
        Command execution
        Process management (foreground and background)
        Basic input/output redirection
        Signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C)
        Simple command parsing

## Getting Started

### Compilation
To compile the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-shell.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
`cd simple-shell`

Compile the shell source code:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`

### Usage

Run the shell:
`./hsh`

You'll see the shell prompt:
`$`

### Enter commands and interact with the shell.
